Hi, my name is Hugo. I'm a PhD candidate at the State University of Campinas, in Environment and Society.

Working on the estimation of carbon sequestration by low carbon agriculture in Brazil.

Interested in using data to make inferences about ecological processes. Enthusiast of data analysis and visualization, open science, reproducibility and accessibility.
