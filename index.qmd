I am a PhD student in Environment and Society by the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP).
I have a great passion on research, data analysis and visualization, which allows me to explore a vast ocean of knowledge.
I also love my cats!

### Education

| **PhD in Environment and Society**
| *Mar 2021 - present*
| *State University of Campinas (UNICAMP)*

| **MSc in Remote Sensing**

| *National Institute for Space Research (INPE)*

| **BSc in Agronomic Engineering**
| *Mar 2011 - June 2017*
| *University of São Paulo (ESALQ)*

### Experience

| **Embrapa Territorial** \| *Research Technician*
| *Mar 2020 - Mar 2021*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since graduation, I have accumulated experience in research, starting with scientific initiation to doctorate, covering a wide range of topics.
Over the years, I acquired a special interest in the area of data analysis, statistics and the development of regression and classification models, trying to create interdisciplinary approaches in my projects.

I believe that my greatest quality as a researcher is that I am a very versatile professional, where I continuously seek to learn a wide variety of techniques, tools and theories to develop research.
As an example, I have experience with programming languages such as R, Python, JavaScript, Julia and SQL, which I use especially (but not exclusively) for model development, data analysis and visualization, and dashboard creation.
I consider these tools fundamental in scientific projects, but they must be founded on a strong theoretical basis, so I also accumulate studies in the area of statistics and causal inference, which allow me to develop good quality projects.
Moreover, I also consider it of great importance to work with organization, and for this I use control tools such as git and github, using fundamentals of project management to be able to produce efficiently.

My core values as a researcher are reproducibility, transparency, and accessibility, which are fundamental principles for developing research in an open and inclusive manner.
In addition, I also highly value building a safe and healthy research environment, free of harassment and discrimination, where problem-solving takes place through dialogue in a respectful way.
