    "text": "This is a list of resources that I am always looking for information, I consider them as essential material for my professional work as a researcher and a data analyst. If you can’t have access to any of these, please, reach me by email so that I can try to help you.\n\nStatistics\n\nStatistical Rethinking (2019)\nThis book is written by Richard McElreath, it talks about a different way of looking at statistics and inferences. His website is also a great source for talks and posts.\n\n\nThe effect (2022)\nThe effect is a gentle introduction to causal inference, written by Nick Huntington-Klein. The first part is an introduction to all the intuition that supports causal inference. The second part is an explanation of different statistical models for causal inference. The language used is accessible and there is not too much math, so the reading is easier than other books.\n\n\nStatistical Inference as Severe Testing (2018)\n\n\nModern Statistics with R (2021)\nThis is a book that covers many aspects of applying statistics in R. There are some chapters with basic material (if you are experienced with R, you are safe to skip them). After chapter 7, there is a wide range of topics on statistics, one of my favorites are the chapters talking about ethics issues with statistical inferences. This is a very applied book, with a lot of code examples in R.\n\n\nStatistical Inference via Data Science (2022)\nAnother hands-on book, with a lot a code in R to apply sampling techniques for statistical inferences. What I really like about this book is that it uses a very didactic approach, and it also applies modern packages (infer, from tidymodels) to perform the statistical inferences.\n\n\n\nProgramming\n\nR for Data Science\nThis is the book that finally made me start thriving in programming and data analyses. It was written by Hadley Wickham (a big reference in the R community). The book is an introduction to the use of a collection of packages, called the tidyverse\n\n\nHappy Git and GitHub for the useR\nThis is an essential book to learn version control with R! It is written by another reference to the R community, Jennifer Bryan. It teaches you how to start integrating your R projects with git and github, such an important resource if you want to produce high quality projects.\n\n\nAdvanced R\nAnother book by Hadley Wickham, but differently from R for Data Science, it teaches specific skills with R that helps specially with the package development. My favorite section is the Functional Programming.\n\n\nMastering Spark with R\nSpark helped me a lot when I needed to analyse a data set that could not fit in my computer memory. Even though I just used I tiny part of the whole capability of Spark, it was a great solution for my problem. I expect working more with Spark, and start using connections and applying machine learning algorithms with Spark.\n\n\n\nData Communication\n\nFundamentals of Data Visualization (2020)\n\n\nggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (2016)\n\n\nChartability\nThe author of chartability is Frank Elavsky, which is a reference for me concerning accessibility. He developed the chartability which is a framework to evaluate and develop more accessible data visualizations. There is also a document explaining the creation and usage of chartability: How accessible is my visualization? Evaluating visualization accessibility with Chartability (2022).\n\n\nHands-On Data Visualization (2022)\n\n\nTelling Stories with Data (2023)\n\n\nReport Writing for Data Science in R (2019)\n\n\n\nModelling\n\nThe Art of Data Science (2018)\n\n\nModern Data Science with R (2021)\n\n\nTidy Modelling with R (2022)\n\n\nHands-On Machine Learning with R (2020)\n\n\nExplanatory Model Analysis (2020)\n\n\nFeature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models (2019)\n\n\nInterpretable Machine Learning (2022)\n\n\nMLU-Explain\n\n\n\nSpatial analysis\n\nGeocomputation with R (2023)\n\n\nSatellite Image Time Series Analysis on Earth Observation Data Cubes (2022)\n\n\nSpatial Data Science (2022)\nThis is a book written by Edzer Pebesma. He is a reference for me, concerning spatial data manipulation. I have learned so much from him, he has made a great work developing R packages for spatial analytics, and really helped the development of this area in the R community. This is an amazing book with essential information for anyone interested on spatial data analysis, and even though it is focused on the R language, it can provide precious information to users of any type!\n\n\n\nProject Management\n\nProject Management Fundamentals for Data Analysts (2021)"

    "text": "Modelling Land Use and Land Cover and Biodiversity in the Amazon\n\nThis is a modelling exercise, in which I used data from the scientific paper: Linking land-use and land-cover transitions to their ecological impact in the Amazon. With this data, I developed prediction models to predict a biodiversity variable, and classification models to classify Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classes.\n\n\n\n\nEstimating the potential carbon sequestration of integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems in Brazil\n\nThis research focuses on estimating the carbon sequestration caused by the expansion of integrated crop-livestock-forestry farming systems in Brazil. Future projections will be performed based on data retrieved from the literature to predict the amount of above and below ground carbon accumulated in these systems along the years.\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimating the effect of forest fires over forest carbon estimates in the Brazillian Amazon\n\nIn this experiment I’m trying to set up a research design to estimate the effect of forest fires over aboveground biomass in the amazon. The biomass estimates are derived from GEDI L4A product. The research design is built upon Mapbiomas land cover and fire data.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating accessible vizualisations of greenhouse gases in Brazil\n\nThis project consists in creating accessible vizualisations of emission data from the Climate Observatory. This is an exercise to improve the accessibility of academic documents in general, following guidelines and tools to facilitate information availability for all.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculation transition time from native forests to agriculture in the Brazzilian Amazon\n\nThis project consists in calculating the time to the conversion from native forests to annual agriculture for the Mapbiomas land cover classification."
