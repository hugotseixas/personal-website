The biomass estimates are derived from GEDI L4A product. The research design is built upon Mapbiomas land cover and fire data.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating accessible vizualisations of greenhouse gases in Brazil\n\nThis project consists in creating accessible vizualisations of emission data from the Climate Observatory. This is an exercise to improve the accessibility of academic documents in general, following guidelines and tools to facilitate information availability for all."
